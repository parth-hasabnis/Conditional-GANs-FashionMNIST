# phasabni-ECE50024
My implementation of Conditional GANs for Purdue ECE 50024: Machine Learning Course Project

To get direct outputs of my code, please run the "CGAN_MNIST_Submit.py" file, with the 'train' variable set to False.
The Baseline is "CGAN_MNIST.ipynb", and is a fork of "https://github.com/qbxlvnf11/conditional-GAN".
